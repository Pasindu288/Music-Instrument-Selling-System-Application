## Problem Overview  

**‚ÄúMusic Background‚Äù**, a leading music instrument shop in Wallawatta town, is highly popular and in demand.  
The shop has several sections:  
- **Selling Section**  
- **Customer Section**  
- **Instrument Section**  

Currently, employees record daily transactions manually in notebooks. This makes it difficult to organize and gather information across all sections efficiently.

## Proposed Solution  

As an IT consultant, I am introducing a **computer-based inventory management system** for the shop. With this system:  
- No need for maintaining multiple notebooks  
- All orders and transactions are automatically stored in the database  
- Employees can filter and access information with just a click  
- The system helps management make better, data-driven decisions  

This solution makes daily operations **easier, faster, and more accurate**.
